## [Exercise 2: Landscape](https://github.com/inarticulatetheory/EECS1710-michelle/tree/main/Exercise2_Landscape)
Landscape driving toward a vanishing point. Navigating the change in perspective with my vanishing point was a challenge, and the math isn't quite completely visually tight.
Unfortunately my landscape began encountering a Java runtime error, but troubleshooting will be an ongoing process.

## [Exercise 1: Drawing](https://github.com/inarticulatetheory/EECS1710-michelle/tree/main/Exercise1_Drawing)
Drawing "graffiti" on the New York subway system of the 1970s.
