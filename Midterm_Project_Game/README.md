## Midterm: One-Button Game
Create the terrible, sad, and angsty poetry of your teenage years! Generates a poem constructed by popping word balloons with a tear. 

Each balloon represents one of 4000 possible word choices. Collaborate with the randomness of the program by stringing together logical sentence patterns and waiting to see the terrible poetry you can write. 

As words are added to the poem, they appear in the background as "constellations," adding to the absurd dream-like world of the game.

Future improvements will be adding the bouncing effect back, for when two bubbles collide and bounce off each other. This broke after other changes were make to the file and I could not get it working again in time.
